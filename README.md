# CSE4019-Digital-Image-Processing---Skin-Cancer-Detection-using-Deep-Learning-and-Medical-Assistance
In order to implement the Skin Cancer Classification and Melanoma Detection using Deep Learning and Medical Assistance project, the following steps need to be followed:

Step 1: Download the ISIC Skin Cancer Classification Dataset from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/data

Step 2: Execute the "model.ipynb" file in order to train and develop the CNN Model for classification of skin cancer images

Step 3: Save the trained model as "model.h5"

Step 4: Install flask in your system using the command: pip install flask

Step 5: Then execute the python file "integrate.py" by running the command: flask integrate.py

Step 6: Open up the index.html file from the "Web Application" Directory or by heading over to 127.0.0.5

Step 7: In the web application, switch over to "Detect Cancer" tab in the navigation bar, upload the lesion image and analyze the type of cancer detected by the model

Step 8: In order to get a list of hospitals near the location of the user, head over to the "Seek Help" tab in the navigation bar, enter the location address and view the hospitals and health centers nearby which offer cancer treatment
